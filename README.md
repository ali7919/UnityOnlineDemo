# Unity online third person template with PUN

### good starting point for an online game
I started with the Third person template from unity and turned it to an online game using PUN(photon unity networking)<br>
I also added a collectable spawning/receiving system that operates on the host and a dance animation which is played when F is pressed

* you should set your own photon app id in \Assets\Photon\PhotonUnityNetworking\Resources\PhotonServerSettings -> App Id PUN
